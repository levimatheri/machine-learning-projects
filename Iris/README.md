# iris-predict-flower
Predict a flower class based on available attributes

Uses the [Iris Plants Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each,
where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is
linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly
separable from each other.

My implementation uses a **Support Vector Machine** (SVM) for classification
